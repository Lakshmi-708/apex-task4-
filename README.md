🔐 Internship Learning Update | Exploitation & System Security

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed Task-4: Exploitation & System Security as part of my internship program at ApexPlanet 🚀

Through this task, I gained hands-on exposure to:
✅ Penetration Testing Methodology
✅ Exploitation using Metasploit
✅ Password Attacks (Hydra, John the Ripper)
✅ Social Engineering (Simulation-based)
✅ Malware Basics & Sandbox Analysis
✅ System Hardening & Security Best Practices

This experience helped me understand real-world cybersecurity threats and how to responsibly identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. It significantly strengthened my practical knowledge in ethical hacking and system security.

Grateful for the guidance and learning opportunities throughout this task. Looking forward to exploring more in the cybersecurity domain! 🔍🛡️
